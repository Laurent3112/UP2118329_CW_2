# Q2 – Neural Network Classifier

In this notebook, a neural network model is trained to solve the same
star–galaxy–QSO classification problem as in Q1.

The dataset and preprocessing steps are kept the same as in Q1 so that
any differences in performance can be attributed to the model itself,
rather than changes in data handling.

Neural networks are more flexible than traditional machine learning
models, but they are also more sensitive to data scaling and training
choices. This notebook introduces a simple feed-forward neural network
and evaluates its performance.
