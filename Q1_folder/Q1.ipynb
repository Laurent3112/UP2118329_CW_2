## Baseline model: Multinomial Logistic Regression

Logistic regression is a simple and commonly used baseline classifier.  
Here we use the multinomial (softmax) version to handle the three classes (STAR, GALAXY, QSO).

from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

# A simple baseline model (multiclass logistic regression)
clf = LogisticRegression(
    max_iter=1000,
    multi_class="multinomial"
)

clf.fit(X_train_s, y_train_e)

# Evaluate on validation set first (so we don't "peek" at the test set yet)
y_val_pred = clf.predict(X_val_s)
val_acc = accuracy_score(y_val_e, y_val_pred)

val_acc

y_test_pred = clf.predict(X_test_s)
test_acc = accuracy_score(y_test_e, y_test_pred)
test_acc


# Q1 – Traditional Machine Learning Baseline

Large astronomical surveys such as the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) contain
very large catalogues of observed objects. Manually classifying these objects
into stars, galaxies, and quasars is not practical, so automated classification
methods are required.

In this notebook, a **traditional machine learning classifier** is trained to
predict whether an object is a **STAR**, **GALAXY**, or **QSO (quasar)**.  
This model will act as a baseline that can later be compared with a neural
network approach in Q2.
